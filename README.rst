Red Pitaya JupyterLab
==============================

Here you can find examples on how to control Red Pitaya through the on-board JupyerLab application.

- OS versions including and up to 2.00-18 use a modified FPGA image reffered to as Mercury.
- OS versions above 2.00-23 use a standard Red Pitaya FPGA image and the JupyterLab commands have been changed, so that they are now the same as C and Python API commands. The new Jupyter commands run corresponding C API functions in the background.

Red Pitaya Jupyter Notebook
==============================

Here you can find examples on how to control Red Pitaya through the on-board Jupyer Notebook application.

OS versions including and up to 2.00-18 use a modified FPGA image reffered to as Mercury.
OS versions above, but not including 2.00-18 use a standard Red Pitaya FPGA image and the Jupyter Notebook commands have been changed, so that they are now the same as SCPI commands for C. The new Jupyter commands run corresponding C functions in the background.
